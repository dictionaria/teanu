## The Teanu language

Welcome to this **online Teanu – English dictionary**.

**Teanu** <small>[iso code: tkw]</small> is the main language spoken on the island of **Vanikoro**, in Temotu, the easternmost province of the Solomon Islands. It has about 1000 speakers, among whom most are on Vanikoro, while others live in the country’s capital Honiara (on Guadalcanal island).

The language receives its name from [_Teanu_](../units/teanu-Teanu_1), the island located northeast of the Vanikoro island group (the second island in size, after Banie). The same language has also been known in the literature as _Puma_ or _Buma_, after the main village of Teanu island.

Vanikoro's traditional context is a society of fishermen and farmers – growing tubers, raising pigs and poultry. 

## The languages of Vanikoro
In earlier times, the island group of Vanikoro used to be divided into three tribal territories, each with its distinctive language: **Teanu** in the northeast, **Lovono** in the west, **Tanema** in the south. During the 20th century, the latter two languages became almost extinct, and replaced with Teanu. In 2012, Lovono was surviving with only 4&nbsp;speakers, and Tanema with only one.

During my fieldwork trips in Vanikoro, I collected linguistic data on those three languages.

Teanu, Lovono and Tanema, the three indigenous languages of Vanikoro, are all **Oceanic**: they thus belong to the vast Austronesian family that covers most islands in the Pacific. Within the Oceanic family (≈500 languages), Vanikoro languages belong to “Temotu” – a smaller subgroup with about ten languages, located in the province of the same name (cf. Glottolog: [_tean1237_](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/tean1237)).

It is likely that Proto-Vanikoro, the ancestors of the three Vanikoro languages, developed _in situ_ following the initial settlement of the region by “Lapita” navigators, about 3200 years ago.

The three languages of Vanikoro clearly share a family resemblance, due to their common ancestry. And yet, what is most striking is the degree of dissimilarity they acquired during the three millennia of human settlement. Whether this is due to tribal isolation, or to processes of spontaneous differentiation, the three languages have long lost mutual intelligibility. (This is the object of a specific study: François 2009.)

The following two examples illustrate how different the three languages of Vanikoro have become in their lexical forms; and yet, they remain closely similar in their grammatical structures.

For each entry in my Teanu dictionary, I will also indicate – whenever I have them – the lexical equivalents in the island's two moribund languages. Lovono has 525 headwords and Tanema 555, covering respectively 37% and 39% of Teanu entries.

These forms can be quite instructive for the historical linguist wishing to compare the three languages of Vanikoro, and reconstruct their history from their Proto Oceanic ancestor. Words from Lovono and Tanema are indispensable in reconstructing “Proto Vanikoro”, the shared ancestor of these three languages.

The meaning of Lovono and Tanema words can safely be assumed to be identical to those of Teanu: this isomorphism is indeed very strong on the island (François 2009).

## Teanu in its regional context
Besides its indigenous Melanesian population, the island of Vanikoro is also home to a Polynesian community that has been colonising the southern shore since at least the 16th century. Their homeland is Tikopia (the easternmost island of the Solomon archipelago), and their language is **Tikopia** or Fakatikopia, a Polynesian outlier language.

&nbsp;

Vanikoro people always had contact, trade exchanges and intermarriage, with the nearby island of Utupua; and to a lesser extent, with other island of the Temotu region: Santa Cruz, the Reefs – as well as Polynesian communities from Tikopia and Vaeakau-Taumako. This contact with Polynesian languages manifests itself in Teanu through many borrowings: 58 exactly (=4&nbsp; percent of the Teanu lexicon).

Contact with other islands of the Temotu region has left much fewer linguistic traces, at least none that are obvious in the present state of knowledge.

Looking further afield, Vanikoro is located only 150&nbsp;km from the Torres islands of northern **Vanuatu**. The extreme linguistic difference between Vanikoro languages on the one hand, and those of the Torres & Banks islands on the other, suggest that there were no in-depth contact between the two regions. 

That said, the myth of the “[_Tamate_](../units/teanu-tamate_1)” spirits tells us how certain dancing headdresses were once borrowed from northern Vanuatu people – perhaps due to a fortuitous encounter [[read the myth here](http://alex.francois.online.fr/AFtxt_tea-tamate_e.htm)]. The word _Tamate_ indeed means ‘spirit’ in Mota, one of the languages of the Banks islands. In total, Teanu has five words that were borrowed from Mota ([_Tamate_](../units/teanu-tamate_1) ‘spirit represented in dances’; [_marama_](../units/teanu-marama_1) ‘world’; [_tapepa_](../units//teanu-tapepa_1) ‘present’; [_totokale_](../units/teanu-totokale_1) ‘picture’; [_wolowolo_](../units/teanu-wolowolo_1) ‘a&nbsp;cross’). These may have entered the Teanu language at the end of the 19th century, when Mota had been chosen by the Melanesian Mission as the language of Christianisation for this part of Melanesia.

Finally, current generations are also experiencing modern life, particularly in the towns of Lata and in the capital Honiara. In urban contexts, the pressure is high to replace indigenous languages such as Teanu with the country's national language **Solomon Islands Pijin** – an English-based creole that emerged during colonial times. All speakers of Teanu are bilingual in Pijin, and some loanwords from English actually enter Teanu through Pijin.

All in all, about 6% of the Teanu lexicon consists of identifiable **borrowings**: 58 words borrowed from Polynesian, 18 from Solomons Pijin or English, 5 words from Mota in Vanuatu. As for the native lexicon, it proves quite original among other Oceanic languages: only 11.1% of entries can be traced back to Proto-Oceanic roots, while 82% of the lexicon has unclear origins. These innovative words probably result from three millennia of language-internal renewal of the lexicon – perhaps encouraged by a trend towards lexical differentiation. In particular, the vocabulary of Vanikoro languages shows extreme dissimilarities with other languages of the area (whether Utupua, Santa Cruz or Reef islands), even though they supposedly belong to the same “Temotu” subgroup of Oceanic. (Whether that “Temotu” subgroup is effectively warranted, is a matter for further historical research.)


## Methodology and data sources

When I began studying it, Teanu was known mostly through wordlists (Tryon & Hackmann 1983), and from a grammatical sketch (Tryon 2002).

Due to its difficult access, I've had only two occasions to visit the island of Vanikoro. One was an archaeological expedition in April-May 2005, organised around the fate of French navigator Jean François de Lapérouse ([_Laperusi_](../units/teanu-Laperusi_1) in Teanu), who had perished on the island in 1788. My second trip was in 2012, with a group of geologists who took me with them for a brief visit to the island; I took that opportunity to collect more data on the island's two moribund languages Lovono and Tanema. To these two short stays, I was able to add a couple encounters with Teanu speakers – in Paris in 2008, in Honiara in 2017; and recently, regular contact with speakers through social media.

Altogether, my linguistic exposure to the language of Teanu was about 29 days in total. But thanks to my knowledge of nearby Vanuatu languages, and to a linguistic questionnaire I had designed (François 2019), I was able to speak and understand Teanu early enough to hold conversations.

My methodology in the field combined language learning, targeted elicitation, and the recording of spontaneous speech in the form of conversations or narratives. Out of the [73 items](https://tiny.cc/AF-ark_Teanu) I recorded in Teanu, 43 were narratives; I transcribed 22 of these with the help of native speakers, yielding a corpus of 18,800 words. Among those transcribed texts, [several are displayed online](https://tiny.cc/AF-ark_Teanu), in open access (_Pangloss collection_, CNRS).

## This dictionary

This bilingual Teanu dictionary is based on my corpus of texts, conversations, elicited data, and immersive fieldwork.

It contains a total of [?? number entries] entries, illustrated by 3,880 example sentences.

While the present _Dictionaria_ edition includes all my lexical data, interested readers can find the same data under a different presentation, on [_tiny.cc/Vanikoro-dict_](https://tiny.cc/Vanikoro-dict).

### Special features
The present dictionary analyzes the words and phrases of the Teanu language, providing definitions in English, together with grammatical comments whenever necessary. It highlights the **polysemy** of many words, and illustrates each sense with example sentences. Most of these examples are taken from my text corpus. In fact, some provide a DOI link to hear the sentence in its original context: e.g. the entry <a href="../units/Teanu-ngiro_1" target="_blank"><b><i>ngiro</i></b></a> ‘wind’ has examples linking to original texts, such as [doi:Pangloss-0003352#S106](https://doi.org/10.24397/pangloss-0003352#S106) or [doi:Pangloss-0003351#S16](https://doi.org/10.24397/pangloss-0003351#S16).

The present work pays attention not just to language and grammar, but also to **culture and society**. Many entries come with photographs, as well as encyclopedic notes: see, for example, entries [_tolosai_](../units/teanu-tolosai_1) 'loincloth', [_savene_](../units/teanu-savene_1) 'valuable mat', [_nuduro_](../units/teanu-nuduro_2) 'scareline', [_mamdeuko_](../units/teanu-mamdeuko_1) 'Cardinal honeyeater'…

Entries usually feature a broad array of **cross-references** to other words: heterosemes (see section on _Lexical flexibility_); antonyms; synonyms; subentries and other derived phrases; and more generally, any other words connected one way or the other. A few dozen entries even provide a whole set of links for a given **lexical domain** – for example:

- the entry for 'fire' [_iawo_](../units/teanu-iawo_1) has a detailed list of vocabulary related to fire ('light a fire', 'flame', 'ashes', 'charcoal'…);

- [_kuo_](../units/teanu-kuo_1) 'canoe' connects to all the technical terms for canoe parts ('hull', 'outrigger', 'boom', 'sail', 'bow' and 'stern'…);

- [_uie luro_](../units/teanu-uie_luro_1) 'coconut palm' links to various objects traditionally woven out of coconut leaves ('mat', 'semi-mat', 'basket', 'fan'…);

- [_ngiro_](../units/teanu-ngiro_1) 'wind' lists the names of all winds, and includes a wind map.

&nbsp;

## Basics of the grammar

An overview of the grammar of Teanu can be found in Tryon (2002) and in François (2009); a more complete grammar is in preparation. The present summary will only highlight a few points that can help the reader make the most of this dictionary.

### Orthography

All forms in this dictionary are transcribed in the language's orthography, accompanied by their phonetic transcription. Teanu's alphabetical order is:
<div style="text-align:center;">{ <strong>a &nbsp; b &nbsp; bw &nbsp; d &nbsp; e &nbsp; g &nbsp; i &nbsp; j &nbsp; k &nbsp; l &nbsp; m &nbsp; mw &nbsp; n &nbsp; ng &nbsp; ñ &nbsp; o &nbsp; p &nbsp; pw &nbsp; r &nbsp; s &nbsp; t &nbsp; u &nbsp; v &nbsp; w</strong> }.</div>

Each of these letters or digraphs corresponds to one phoneme in the language.

### Phonology
Teanu has 18 phonemic consonants. Table 2 lists the phonemes themselves (using IPA); and in brackets, the orthographic symbol. For example, letter &lt;j&gt; in the orthography encodes the prenasalized palatal stop /ᶮɟ/ .

- The phoneme /v/ can surface as voiced [v], but also as voiceless [f], especially word-initially: e.g. [_vede_](../units/teanu-vede_1) [feⁿde] ‘pandanus’; [_evele_](../units/teanu-evele_1) [evele] ~ [efele] ‘falcon’.
- There is no phonemic palatal glide _y_ [j]: it only exists as an allophone of /i/ before another vowel: e.g. [_iebe_](../units/teanu-iebe_1) [i.e.ᵐbe] ~ [je.ᵐbe] ‘besom, broom’.

### Phonotactics

Teanu shows a preference for open syllables CV, and all words end in a vowel. However, consonant clusters are sometimes found word-internally (resulting historically from the syncope of a high vowel /i/ or /u/):

### Word classes

Every word can be assigned at least one class (or &quot;syntactic category&quot; or &quot;part of speech&quot;), based on its grammatical behaviour. Thus [_moe_](../units/teanu-moe_1) 'house' is a noun; [_aplaka_](../units/teanu-aplaka_1) 'crazy' is an adjective; [_~aiae_](../units/teanu-LX000012) '(be) difficult' is an intransitive verb; [_~ago_](../units/teanu-LX000010) 'shoot, spear' a transitive verb, etc.

One of the characteristics of verbs is that they are bound forms, requiring a subject prefix: this is indicated with a tilde sign **~** before the radical. Thus [_~abu_](../units/teanu-LX000002) 'go down' cannot appear on its own, it needs a prefix such as 3sg [_i-_](../units/teanu-i-_1), yielding a citable form like _**i**-abu_ [iaᵐbu] ‘he's going down’. In this dictionary, the phonetic transcription of verbs will thus add a prefix in brackets, like [(**i·**)aᵐbu].

#### Lexical flexibility

In my syntactic analysis (explained in François 2017), a given word can show lexical flexibility, by being assigned several word classes – similar to English <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">[n.]</span> _snow_, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">[v.]</span> _snow_. Rather than calling them &quot;homophones&quot;, I propose to analyze such examples (_snow_, _snow_) as &quot;heterosemes&quot; – i.e. identical forms linked by a relationship of &quot;heterosemy&quot; (conversion), and showing different grammatical behaviour: thus the Eng. noun _snow_ and the verb _snow_ would not be homophones in English, but “heterosemes”.

While homophones are treated as separate entries, my [original dictionary](https://tiny.cc/Vanikoro-dict) treats all heterosemes under a single entry, which is split into separate lexical sections: e.g. _biouro_ <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">‹a›</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">[adj]</span> 'long' – <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">‹b›</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">[n]</span> 'length' – <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">‹c›</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">[adv]</span> 'at length', etc. Yet for technical reasons, the present _Dictionaria_ platform had to treat all heterosemes ({form / word class} pairing) as separate entries, as though they were homophones: e.g. [_biouro 1_](../units/teanu-biouro_1), [_biouro 2_](../units/teanu-biouro_2), [_biouro 3_](../units/teanu-biouro_3); they are mutually linked with a label &quot;heteroseme(s)&quot;.

### Types of nouns

#### Possession

Nouns are also divided along a second split, regarding not whether they can be prefixed, but suffixed, indexing a possessor:

- **independent** (~ intransitive ~ alienable) nouns:
the majority of nouns can occur without a possessor – e.g. _moe_ 'house', _kuo_ 'canoe'
- **relational** (~ transitive ~ inalienable) nouns:
about 115 nouns of Teanu are relational nouns, which demand a possessor. This is particularly true of kinship nouns (e.g. [_uku_](../units/teanu-biouro_2) 'father-in-law (of s.o.)'), body parts ([_ma_](../units/teanu-ma_1) 'arm, hand (of s.o.)'), and other relational nouns ([_enga_](../units/teanu-enga_1) 'name (of s.o.)').

&nbsp;

### Pronominal indexing

The personal pronouns of Teanu distinguish three numbers: singular, dual, plural. They also strictly encode the contrast between 'inclusive _we_' [=you &amp; me &amp; others] and 'exclusive _we_' [me &amp; others]. Thus the pronoun [_kia_](../units/teanu-kia_1) &quot;1inclusive: dual&quot; means 'you &amp; me', whereas [_keba_](../units/teanu-keba_1) &quot;1exclusive: dual&quot; will read as 'one person (other than you) + myself', i.e. 'me &amp; him/her'.

The  personal pronouns of Teanu distinguish three numbers: singular, dual, plural.  Free pronouns can serve as subject, object of transitive verbs, object of  prepositions. In addition, all verbs require a subject prefix, which  distinguishes realis vs. irrealis mood.

### Possessive marking

Teanu encodes possession in a pattern {Possessed + Possessor}. When that possessor is not a noun but a pronoun, it is encoded by a “personal possessive”. But the form taken by that personal possessive will depend on the exact meaning of the possessive relationship. Most of the time, this amounts to assigning the possessed noun to a certain possessive class:

1. _body parts + relational nouns_ <br/>= {N + free pronoun} <sup>(see Table&nbsp;5)</sup><br/>
→ _visibaele **ene**_ ‘my knee’; _enga **ini**_ ‘his/her name’; _vilisa **dapa**_ ‘their clothes’;<br/>→ _awa Teliki_ ‘Teliki's desire’. 

1. _kinship nouns_ <br/>= {N + [KIN possessive](../units/teanu-one_1)} <br/>
→ _uk' [**one**](../units/teanu-one_1)_ ‘my father-in-law’; _et’ [**iape**](../units/teanu-iape_2)_ ‘his/her mother’; _gi’ [**adapa**](../units/teanu-adapa_2)_ ‘their uncle’;<br/>→ _ai’ [**ie**](../units/teanu-ie_2) Teliki_ ‘Teliki's father’.

1. _food + drink + tools + certain objects_ <br/>= {N + [FOOD possessive](../units/teanu-enaka_1)} <br/>
→ _buioe [**enaka**](../units/teanu-enaka_1)_ ‘my betelnut’; _laro [**ape**](../units/teanu-ape_1)_ ‘his/her drinking coconut’; _piene [**adapa**](../units/teanu-adapa_1)_ ‘their language’;<br/>→ _okoro [**we**](../units/teanu-we_2) Teliki_ ‘Teliki's knife’.

1. _other possessions_ <br/>= {NOP + [GENERAL possessive](../units/teanu-enone_1)} <br/>
→ _moe [**’none**](../units/teanu-enone_1)_ ‘my house’; _emel’ [**iape**](../units/teanu-iape_1)_ ‘his wife’; _kulumoe [**iadapa**](../units/teanu-iadapa_1)_ ‘their village’<br/>
→ _men’ [**ie**](../units/teanu-ie_1) Teliki_ ‘Teliki's child’.
