\tin Li-miñi aña dameliko
\tiv Inheriting from the father
\cona Due to the matrilineal structure of Vanikoro society, children automatically inherit land and property from their mother's clan. But a special ritual of transmission (|fv{~mini aña  (dameliko)}) is required from the father to his children, to ensure that they will also inherit from their father's clan (|fv{basa_3}) when he dies. The clan of the mother – represented by the children’s uncle (|fv{gi' adapa}) – brings presents to the father in the form of mat money (|fv{savene}) or shellmoney (|fv{viko}). This will be a way, for the mother’s clan, to symbolically “buy the clan” (|fv{li-sava basa}) – i.e. buy land rights from the father’s clan.

The ship split in two, one part sinking in the ocean, another part wrecking on the reef, off Paiou (|vl{Paeu}). Some men survived the tempest, and remained on the island for some time, building a new ship to escape; one day, they finally out took to the ocean.

\tiv leka
\cona The kin relation between opposite-sex cross-cousins (|vl{leka}) is sacred (|vl{etapu}) – associated with awe, fear and avoidance. Thus if I swear (|vl{~aptei}) on s.o.'s life, that will be on my cross-cousin. 
\cona Any sort of contact between cross-cousins of opposite sex, whether eye- or body-contact, is strictly prohibited. If it ever occurs, then the two individuals must marry (|vl{~kila_2–2}). As a consequence, cross-cousins – who can be potentially spouses – avoid each other strictly. Mwasu, a mythological figure, infringed those rules, and caused a disaster on the island.

\tin Dance festivals
\tiv Li-mini ngapiene
\cona Among major community events on Vanikoro, the main one was a dance festival called |vl{ngapiene}. While such events occur seldom nowadays, they are central to many traditional stories. The festival revolved around a sort of greasy pole (|vl{blateno}), erected in the middle of the village area (|vl{mane}), loaded with fruit and food. Stomping boards (|vl{tepapa}*) were laid out in a circle all around that pole, half-buried in the ground; for days on end, villagers would stomp those boards (|vl{~wate tepapa}) and dance (|vl{~mako}, |vl{~pinoe}) in a joyful and rowdy atmosphere. Such dancing festivals could last for several weeks on end, bringing the whole community together.
